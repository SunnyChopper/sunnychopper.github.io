2. Specialized Domain Knowledge
3. Reasoning and Analytical Abilities
4. Creativity and Open-Ended Generation
5. Factual Accuracy and Up-to-Date Knowledge
6. Speed and Computational Efficiency
7. Context Window Size
8. Multimodal Capabilities
9. Ethical Considerations and Safety

Based on the input, analyze the project requirements and generate a list of model characteristics. For each characteristic, consider:

1. How it relates to the project type and goals
2. Its relevance to the key features required
3. How it aligns with any specified constraints
4. Its importance for the domain expertise needed
5. Its impact on data privacy concerns (if any)

- characteristic: The specific model characteristic (e.g., "language understanding", "domain expertise", "reasoning ability")
- importance: A number from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most important. The importance levels do not need to be in descending order and can be the same for multiple characteristics if justified.
- justification: A brief explanation of why this characteristic has the assigned importance level for the project
- related_key_factor: The key factor from the list above that this characteristic primarily relates to

The "additional_considerations" array should contain any other factors that might influence model selection but don't fit into specific characteristics.

Ensure your response is a valid JSON object and includes at least 7 prioritized characteristics, covering all relevant key factors from the list provided.

Filtering Criteria:
1. Hard Constraints: Eliminate models that do not meet the minimum thresholds for characteristics marked with an importance level of 8 or higher.
2. Soft Constraints: For characteristics with an importance level of 6-7, prefer models that excel but do not eliminate models solely based on these attributes.
3. Additional Considerations: Apply these as soft constraints to further refine the selection without strictly eliminating models.
4. Top 3 Selection: After filtering, rank the remaining models based on how well they meet the prioritized characteristics and their potential for innovative applications. Choose a diverse set of 3 models with varying strengths and capabilities.
5. Creative Leverage: For each selected model, consider how its unique strengths can be creatively applied to meet project requirements, even if it's not the highest-scoring model in all areas.

Guidelines for crafting your masterpiece:

1. The "type" field should be either "single-model" or "multi-model".
2. For multi-model solutions, orchestrate a detailed workflow that showcases the unique role of each model and how they harmonize.
3. Let your justifications tell a compelling story, connecting project requirements with model characteristics in unexpected ways.
4. Explore innovative approaches to cost-effectiveness, performance trade-offs, and implementation complexity.
5. In "final_considerations", propose creative solutions and envision future possibilities that could redefine the project's potential.
6. For each task in the workflow:
   a. Provide a clear, descriptive name and explanation of the task's purpose.
   b. Specify which model performs the task and why it's best suited for it. If only one model is used, provide details on the model's capabilities and why it's the best choice.
   c. Define precise input and output JSON contracts as strings. These should be valid JSON structures that can be directly implemented.
   d. Ensure that the output_contract of each task aligns with the input_contract of the next_step, creating a seamless flow of data.
   e. For the first task, assume a user input structure that makes sense for the task. For the last task, ensure the output represents the final result.
   f. Focus on practical, actionable outputs that provide tangible value. Each task should contribute to a concrete, useful end result.

7. Ensure the overall workflow leads to a specific, valuable outcome. This could be:
   - A detailed action plan
   - A comprehensive analysis with actionable insights
   - A creative solution to a complex problem
   - A data-driven decision framework
   - An innovative product or service concept

8. Incorporate creative applications of the models' strengths, such as:
   - Using a model's scientific knowledge for novel problem-solving approaches
   - Leveraging a model's language capabilities for advanced communication strategies
   - Combining models' strengths for unique data analysis and visualization techniques

9. Analyze the user's input task to determine if there's a specific JSON structure required for the final output. If so, include this structure in the "final_output_structure" field for each recommendation.

Example task structure:

\`\`\`json
{
  "name": "Market Trend Analysis and Prediction",
  "description": "Analyze current market data and predict future trends, providing actionable insights for product development",
