## About Me
I started my coding journey when I was 14. My father would not pay for Xbox Live, so I took initiative to make some money. I picked up coding and created a few websites for friends. I was able to pay for Xbox Live.

From there, my curiosity took over and I've been learning about computers ever since. I take pride in my ability to learn concepts extremely quickly and the fact that I can put a Udemy or YouTube video on 2x speed and retain all the information.
